Who am I? What am I doing?
(No, these are not deep philosophical questionsâ€”just a way to introduce myself!)

Q1: Who am I?
A1:
I'm just a mechanical engineering grad student who's really into transport phenomena, especially meso-scale flows. Sometimes, I use analytical approaches to explore these phenomena, and other times I dive into meso-scale computational tools like the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).

Q2: What am I doing?
A2:
To be humble, maybe nothing. But let's be a bit professional and check out the projects I'm involved in:
* Investigating liquid-vapor interface instabilities using LBM (Python, FORTRAN).
* Developing a MATLAB code to characterize the vapor flow in flat heat pipes.

My Past Code-Based Projects:
* Simulated transient heat transfer using MATLAB.
* Analyzed fluid flow in a cavity using MATLAB.
* Conducted a 3E Analysis of a multi-objective cycle containing a solar collector, thermoelectric 
  systems, etc., via MATLAB.
* Performed a 3E Analysis of a multi-objective cycle involving MED, RO, etc., via MATLAB.
* Solved thermal and hydrodynamic laminar boundary layers via MATLAB.

My Past Software-Based Projects:
* Carried out economic analysis and life cycle assessment of processes using SAM, Homer Pro, 
  and SimaPro.
* Solved an analytical solution for a falling film involving heat transfer and the 
  thermocapillary effect.
* Performed kinematic and dynamic analysis of a quick-return mechanism via Working Model.
* Designed a cylindrical oscillating steam engine using CATIA.

APOLOGY:
Sorry for my reports being in Persian; I will translate them into English as soon as I can!
